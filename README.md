# NFT Collection Generator

## About
This is a simple Node.js project that uses a list of pre-configured traits and image layers to generate a unique set of images and metadata files for a collection of NFTs. You would be able to create your own collection by updating the image layers and the traits configuration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Download and install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/manuelpires/nft-collection-generator.git
   ```

2. Inside the repo directory install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
There's an example configuration in the `config.js` file, and there's also some pre-defined image layers in the `traits` folder. You can test and run this project with that pre-existing configuration to see first how everything works and to see the results.

### Test the configuration
Test the current configuration in the `config.js` file
```sh
npm test
```
This will only test if the current configuration is correct or not.

### Run the project
Run the project with the current configuration
```sh
npm start
```
This will execute the main script. If successful, it will:
- Print logs with statistics about the results in the console
- Generate a folder with all the tokens images
- Generate a folder with all the tokens metadata files

## Update Configuration and Traits Image Layers
To create your own collection of unique tokens, you'd have to edit only the `config.js` file and update the image layers in the `traits` folder.

The metadata generated by running this project should be compatible with [OpenSea's Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards). If you are not familiarized with those standards, you should give that page a read as it would help a lot to understand how to update the `config.js` file. Also, make sure to run the project with the example data and check out the generated metadata files for more clarification about the process.

These are the constants that you'd need to update in the `config.js` file:
```JS
config.IMAGES_BASE_URL = "https://base-url-to-my-nft-images.com/";
config.TOKEN_NAME_PREFIX = "My NFT #";
config.TOKEN_DESCRIPTION = "My NFT description.";
config.TOTAL_TOKENS = 100;
```

You'd also have to modify the last constant called `ORDERED_TRAITS_LIST` that contains the array of all available traits for the tokens.
Each *trait* has the following structure:

```JS
{
  display?: string;
  type?: string;
  options: {
    image?: string;
    value?: string | number;
    weight: number;
  }[]
}
```

Before modifying the *traits* list, please go through the next important considerations:
- For each *trait* in the list, each generated token will get **one** randomly selected *option* (*value* & *image*) from the *options* list. Except if the randomly selected *option* for that *trait* turns out to have a non-existent *value*, in which case the token won't get **anything** from that specific *trait*.
- The order of the list **is important!** It will define in which order the images should be merged on top of each other to create the final token image. Tipically, the background *trait* should be the first in the array.
- The random selection of the *option* is based on its *weight*. The *weight* of an *option* is **relative** to the *weights* of the other items in the same *options* array, and it should be an integer of at least 1. So if you put a *weight* of 10 in an *option*, it should have 10 more times chances to be selected that an *option* in the same array that has a *weight* equal to 1.
- Each defined *type* inside a *trait* should be unique.
- If you leave a specific *trait* without a *type* field, it will be considered a "generic" *trait*. It's important that these kind of *traits* don't have any *values* in common with other *traits* inside their *options* array.
- Each *image* string should have the relative path to a specific PNG image.
- If you don't put an *image* field in each one of the *options* with *value*, some of your tokens (even with unique metadata) could turn out with the same generated image.
- Be careful with the *display* field, they are only meant to be used with number *values*. Read more at the [OpenSea's Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).
- Depending on the amount of *traits* that you have and their amount of *options*, you will have a maximum amount of unique tokens that could be generated. It isn't recommended generating the exact maximum possible amount of unique tokens, because the script will keep searching no matter the odds until it finds each one of the combinations, leaving the weighting factors useless. As a recommendation, I would say that if you want to generate N tokens, then create a list of *traits* that can give you **at least** 2N tokens. The process will let you know if the value of `TOTAL_TOKENS` is too big when you try to run it.
